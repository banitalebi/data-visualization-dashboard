# Data visualization dashboard starter

This project serves as an excellent starting point for developing an interactive and engaging dashboard designed for effective data visualization and analysis. Built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for the frontend, this dashboard offers a user-friendly interface that empowers users to explore diverse datasets through dynamic charts and graphs, all enhanced by the capabilities of **shadcn/ui**. 

The backend will be powered by a high-performance Rust API, while MongoDB will serve as a demonstration example for data storage.
